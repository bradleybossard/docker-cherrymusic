[media]

; BASEDIR specifies where the media that should be served is located. It must be
; an absolute path, e.g. BASEDIR=/absolute/path/to/media.
; 
; Links: If your operating system supports them, you can use symlinks directly in
; BASEDIR. Links to directories which contain BASEDIR will be ignored, just like
; all links not directly in, but in sublevels of BASEDIR. This is to guard against
; the adverse effects of link cycles.
; 
basedir = /music

; TRANSCODE (experimental!) enables automatic live transcoding of the media to be
; able to listen to every format on every device. This requires you to have the
; appropriate codecs installed. Please note that transcoding will significantly
; increase the stress on the CPU!
; 
transcode = False

; Show the number of sub-folders and tracks contained in any folder. This will
; increase the stress for the server, so if you're running CherryMusic on a 386DX
; II or similar, it is recommended to deactivate this feature.
; 
fetch_album_art = False
show_subfolder_count = True

; Maximum size in bytes of all files to be downloaded in one zipfile. Defaults to
; 250 megabytes.
; 
maximum_download_size = 262144000

[search]

; MAXRESULTS sets the maximum amount of search results to be displayed. If
; MAXRESULTS is set to a higher value, the search will take longer, but will also
; be more accurate.
; 
maxresults = 20

; This will load parts of the database into memory for improved performance. This
; option should only be used on systems with sufficient memory, because it will
; hurt the performance otherwise.
; 
load_file_db_into_memory = False

[browser]

; MAXSHOWFILES specifies how many files and folders should be shown at the same
; time. E.g. if you open a folder with more than MAXSHOWFILES, the files will be
; grouped according to the first letter in their name. 100 is a good value, as a
; CD can have up to 99 tracks.
; 
maxshowfiles = 100

; Only use the media database, never the filesystem, for content lookups in
; browser and search. Useful if the media files reside on an external hard drive
; or behind a slow network connection.

[server]

; The port the server will listen to.
; 
port = 8080

; When set to true, the server will listen on a IPv6 socket instead of IPv4
; 
ipv6_enabled = False

; when localhost_only is set to true, the server will not be visible in the
; network and only play music on the same computer it is running on.
; 
localhost_only = False

; The path cherrymusic will be available on. Normally you'll want to leave it as
; '/', so that CherryMusic is available under e.g. localhost:8080. You might want
; to change the path if CherryMusic runs behind a reverse proxy. Changing it to
; '/cherrymusic' will make it available under e.g. localhost:8080/cherrymusic
;

; When localhost_auto_login is set to "True", the server will not ask for
; credentials when using it locally. The user will be automatically logged in as
; admin.
; 
localhost_auto_login = False

; When permit_remote_admin_login is set to "False", admin users may only log in
; from the computer cherrymusic is currently running on. This can improve
; security.
; 
permit_remote_admin_login = True

; Will keep the user sessions in RAM instead of a file in the configuration
; directory. This means, that any unsaved playlists will be lost when the server
; is restarted.
; 
keep_session_in_ram = False

; The following options allow you to use cherrymusic with https encryption. If
; ssl_enabled is set to "False", all other ssl options will be ommited.
; 
ssl_enabled = False

; The port that will listen to SSL encrypted requests. If ssl_enabled is set to
; "True", all unencrypted HTTP requests will be redirected to this port.
; 
ssl_port = 8443

; The SSL certiticate sent to the client to verify the server's authenticity. A
; relative path is relative to the location of the CherryMusic configuration file.
; 
ssl_certificate = certs/server.crt

; SSL private key file used by the server to decrypt and sign secure
; communications. Keep this one secret! A relative path is relative to the
